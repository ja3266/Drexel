## Introduction
Project management dates back to the early 1960s in construction and the DOD. They need ed a way to manage projects with compliance, budgets, and schedules in mind so they created the origins of what is now project management.

Early-on it was seen as more of a part-time gig. 

As technology started to advance and things were moving more quickly, companies started to realize how complex it was to manage resources and staffing. They changed their management structure to include project managers that would keep all of that in mind with the project it self, and it became a lot more adaptable. 

Many execs didn't accept the change, because they didn't want to abandon the traditional superior-subordinate managerial structure of the past. 

After a few economic crises, executives reconsidered the need for project managers that could emphasize more control over resources, better manage a portfolio of projects, and maximize the value that they brought to their companies. 

Almost all execs today are convinced that project management is effective and works well. IT has spread to many industries and facets of those industries. 

## Understanding Project Management
First we must start with the definition of a project. **A project can be considered to be any series of activities and tasks that:**
- Have a specific objective
- Have a defined start and end date
- Have funding limits
- Consume human and nonhuman resources
- Are multi functional

There are 5 process groups that are necessary to achieve project requirements:
1. Project Initiation
2. Project Planning
3. Project Execution
4. Project Monitoring
5. Project Closure

Many companies created a singular methodology that would hit all of these groups that was required to follow. Each group had documentation requirements and performance measurements. 

There are 8 performance domain areas that are critical to repetitive project success:
1. Stakeholders
2. Team
3. Development Approach and Life Cycle
4. Planning
5. Project Work
6. Delivery
7. Measurement
8. Uncertainty

Here is an overview definition of project management:
"Project management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific project (the horizontal hierarchy)."
