### Content
- What is the purpose of doing research as part of the design process? What are the two main categories of research?
    
    The purpose of doing research as a part of the design process is to understand the space that you want to study so that you can identify problems within it and develop solutions for those problems. The two main categories of research are quantitative resarch, which deals in numbers and mathematical analysis of those numbers, and quantitative research which deals more in words and how those words can lead to trends/patterns to be analyzed. 

- How should you choose what data gathering methods to use in a design project? 

    Data gathering methods should be chosen depending on the goals of the design project. For our project, we're dealing mostly with UI changes to improve upon existing sports betting/statistics tools, so data gathering methods that apply more towards qualitative research may be more applicable. We decided to go with semi-structured interviews and observations for a few primary reasons: we want to know what tools people are using for bettings and why, we want to know what exactly are the pain points within those tools, we want to know how long it takes people to find the information they want, what information they want, and how many clicks it may take in order to do it. We figured that the interviews can provide good context into what tools people use and what they like/dislike about them, and the observations can provide the more quantitative information such as the time and number of clicks used to find information. 

- What is something surprising that you learned is involved in design research? (Something unexpected that came up in the chapters, lecture or GP assignments)
- What is a big-picture summary of what your group wrote for GP1?- What forms of research were involved in GP1? What forms do you anticipate being involved in GP2?
- What role do you think GP1 will play in the complete group project? Put differently: if the whole project is a puzzle, how does GP1 fit in?  
- What are some of the challenges and benefits of working with a group that you noticed while working on GP1?

## Thesis

What I have learned regarding design research is the thought process for how to go about solving problems. The combination of data gathering and data analysis techniques compounded with the lessons learned from GP1's framing the design problem lessons have taught me how to better attack problems. For design, I now know that I should first identify the space that I want to study, identify the problem space, gather data about that problem space, and analyze the data using a combination of techniques to find any trends or patterns that could help me solve the problem. However, I think that this method of thinking and system for attacking problems is not only applicable to design but is just a great method for solving problems in general. 

## Outline
- Introduction

    Compounding on my responses from mini-essay 1, I have found that studying data gathering and analysis in chapters 8, 9, and 11 has further changed the way that I think about attacking problems. First, I learned how to properly identify the problem space by asking a series of questions about who the users are and what their needs may be, and now I have learned how to gather relevant data and analyze that data to further study the problem and start to think about where potential solutions may lie. These ideas that I am learning about how to make good interactive design I believe to be very applicable to other aspects of my studies and of my life in general, and I am looking to practice them wherever I can.
