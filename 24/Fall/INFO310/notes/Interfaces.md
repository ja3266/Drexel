# Summary
This chapter summarizes the diverse amount of interfaces that could be designed for user experiences. It explained the benefits of different interfaces, and the interaction types that are suited for each type of interface. It also explained some of the dilemmas facing designers when using particular interfaces.

# Key Points
- Many interfaces have emerged recently like voice, wearable, mobile, tangible, brain-computer, smart, robots, and drones.
- Make sure you really put some thought into choosing what kind of interface you want and what features to include in that interface.
- Natural UIs may not be as natural as GUIs.
- A key point of designing an interface is representing information to the user so that they can make sense of it in the context of what they're doing.
- New interfaces that monitor people or are context-aware raise ethical concerns about data collection.
# Assigned Section
## 7.2.7 Appliances
- Appliances include machines for everyday use in the home. Microwaves, ovens, refrigerators...
- Many people just want to intuitively use them, not having to spend time figuring out all the features or how they work.
- Many now have LED displays and connect to the internet.
- Some now have IoT tech that allows users to control it from their phone, or control it via voice like with Siri or Alexa.
### Research and Design Considerations
Researchers suggest that interfaces on appliances should be considered as "transient", meaning that the interaction is short. A few structured buttons is better than a massive array of confusing inputs. 

Some feedback is good, like knowing exactly how long the washer/dryer are going to take, but there are trade offs with screens over simple buttons or knobs. 

# In-Class Questions
1. Describe your interface type in a sentence or two.
Appliances are interfaces that people use for every-day mundane tasks. 

2. Give an example of a system using that interface type.
Microwaves, ovens, refrigerators, etc..

3. Share 1-2 takeaways from the Research and Design Considerations box.
Appliance interfaces should be very straightforward, structured and functional. These designs should be transient, meaning they should be short interactions that don't require much learning to use them.
