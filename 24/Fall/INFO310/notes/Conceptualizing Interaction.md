Summary: This chapter emphasizes the importance of conceptualizing and understanding the problem/design spaces before making any moves. Its like understanding the pieces on the chess board before moving your pieces. It describes a few approaches for formulating some conceptual model of the problem, and considered other ways of conceptualizing interaction. 

Key Points:
- A fundamental part of interaction design is developing a conceptual model.
- ==Conceptual model== = description of what users can do with a product and what they need to understand to use it.
- Understanding the problem space helps understand what they're making the product for.
- CONCEPTUAL decisions FIRST, PHYSICAL decisions SECOND.
- ==Interface metaphors== are commonly used as a part of a conceptual model
- ==Interaction types== provide a way of thinking about how to best support the users.
- ==Paradigms==, ==visions==, ==theories==, ==models==, and ==frameworks== provide different ways of framing and informing design and research.

Key Ideas:
- Conceptual Model:
	- Model: Describing how a process works.
	- Conceptual Model: A model that describes what people can do with a product and what people need to understand to use it. 
	- Core components
		- Metaphors and analogies that help people understand the product (i.e. browsing and bookmarking)
		- Concepts that the products introduces
		- Relationships between concepts
		- Mappings between concepts and the UX product is designed to support
- Interface Metaphors 
	- Provide a structure that is familiar to the user.
	- Instantiated in some way as part of the user interface, such as the "desktop".
- Interaction Types
	- Instructing: Users issue instructions to the system.
	- Conversing: Users have a dialog with the system.
	- Manipulating: Users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space.
	- Exploring: Where users move through a virtual environment or physical space.
	- Responding: Where the system initiates the interaction and the user chooses whether to respond. 
- Paradigms
	- Adopting a set of practices upon which a community has agreed.
	- The questions to be asked and how they should be framed.
	- The phenomena to be observed.
- Visions
	- Visions of the future of a product and how it will be used in a given amount of time. 
	- Ex. AI and how everyone has a different vision about its uses going forward.
- Theories
	- Predicting the performance of users carrying out tasks using the product. 
- Models
	- Same as above
- Frameworks
	- Advice for what to design or look for. Different from models because models describe the problem space or design space of the product, where frameworks are a general guideline of advice for how to go about it.
