## Summary

## Outline
###  1.1 Introduction
Interaction design involves the process of designing products withe that are pleasurable for the user to use. Something that doesn't want to make you smash something after it won't work right, something seamless that everyone understands like the iPhone. 
### 1.2 Good and Poor Design
To analyse good interactive designs, you can start thinking about products that you know are good or bad to use.
#### 1.2.1 Voice-Mail System
Hotel voice-mail machines, and voice-mail machines in general, can be infurating to use because of their confusing buttons, non-labeled lights, and unintuitvie directions on how to use it. They're 
* Infuriating
* Confusing
* Inefficient
* Difficult

However this machine pictured functions thorugh marbles that run on a track, which makes it easier to see when you have a message, then to play that message you place it in the slot and it will play. This is somewhat of a child's toy but it is effective in being intuitive and functional. Now its not exactly practical but the point is is that its something that people **want to use**.
