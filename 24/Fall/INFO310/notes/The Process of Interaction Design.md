## Objectives
- Reflect on what interaction design involves
- Explain some of the advantages of involving users in development.
- Explain the main principles of a user-centered approach.
- Introduce the four basic activities of interaction design and how they are related in a simple life cycle model.
- Ask some important questions about the interaction design process and provide answers
- Consider how interaction design activities can be integrated into other development cycles

## Summary
Key points:
- Different design disciplines follow different approaches but they have commonalities that are captured in the double diamond of design.
- It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space before trying to build anything.
- The interaction design process consists of four basic activities: discover requirements, design alternatives that meet those requirements, prototype the designs so that they can be communicated and assessed, and evaluate them. 
- User-centered design rests on three principles: early focus on users and tasks, empirical measurement, and iterative design. 
- Involving users in the design process assists with expectation management and feelings of ownership, but how and when to involve users requires careful planning.
- There are many ways to understand who users are and what their goals are in using a product, including rapid iterations and working prototypes.
- Looking at other's designs and involving other people provides useful inspiration and encourages designers to consider alternative design solutions which is key to effective design.
- Usability criteria, technical feasibility, and user's feedback on prototypes can all be used to choose among alternatives.
- Prototyping is a useful technique for facilitating user feedback on designs at all stages.
- Interaction design activities are becoming better integrated with life cycle models from other related disciplines like SE. 

## Outline
### 2.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the process of how interaction design works. It starts with four phases:
1. Discover: Data gathering and such.
2. Define: Designers develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge.
3. Develop: Solutions or concepts that are created, prototyped, tested and iterated.
4. Deliver: The resulting project is finalized, produced and launched.
### 2.2 What is involved in interaction design?
Interaction design is focused on the user and their goals. This means that involving users in the design process is key to interaction design. A good way to start is to build prototypes and show them to users to get feedback.
#### 2.2.1 Understanding the problem space
This is understanding the niche that your design will fit into. Does it already exist? Is it necessary? Will people use it? That kind of thing. You're scoping out where your product fits within the space of other products.

#### 2.2.2 The importance of involving users
The best way to design something with users in mind is to first consider what they even want. The best way to do that is to involve them heavily in the design process, this way they steer you in the right direction with every move you make. 

Another good point about involving users is that if they contribute to it's design they gain a sense of ownership, leading to prolonged use and loyalty to the product.

#### 2.2.3 Degrees of User Involvement
There are varying degrees of involvement that a user can have in design, with each having its own pros and cons. The reality is that individual circumstances determine what level of involvement is appropriate for the design.

#### 2.2.4 What is a user-centered approach
There are three principles that should be kept in mind:
1. Early focus on users and tasks: understanding the users directly by studying their characteristics. 
2. Empirical Measurement: Reactions and performance of intended users to prototypes.
3. Iterative Design: Designing in steps. Designing a bit, testing, asking for feedback, fixing, designing, testing...

**Early Focus on Users and Tasks**
This can be expanded:
1. Users tasks and goals are the driving force behind development
2. User's behavior and context of use are studied, and the system is designed to support them
3. User's characteristics are captured and designed for
4. Users are consulted throughout development from earliest phases to latest.
5. All design decisions are taken within context of the users, their activities, and their environment

**Empirical Measurement**
Specific usability and ux goals should be identified, documented, and agreed upon at the beginning of the project.

**Iterative Design**
Iteration allows designs to be refined based on feedback during the process, not after. Takes a lot of patience to do. 

#### 2.2.5 Four basic activities of interaction design
1. Discovering requirements for the interactive product.
2. Designing alternatives that meet those requirements.
3. Prototyping the alternative designs so that the can be communicated and assessed. 
4. Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout the process

#### 2.2.6 A simple life cycle model for interaction design

### 2.3 Some Practical Issues
- Who are the users?
- What are the user's needs?
- How to generate alternative designs
- How to choose among alternatives
- How to integrate interaction design activities with other lifecycle models

#### 2.3.1 Who are the users?
Identifying stakeholders of a product can help identify how to design a product. Stakeholders meaning the people who pay for it, the users who interact with it, the developers that design, build, and maintain it, the legislators who impose rules about it, the people who may lose their jobs because of its introduction, and so on. Considering more than just the direct user could help. 

#### 2.3.2 What are the user's needs?
Studying user's and observing their behaviors and characteristics, combined with actually asking the user's what they want to use can help identify what user needs are.
