# Notes
- We have two sides of the brain: 
	- Right: Generating ideas
	- Left: judging and improving ideas
- Brainstorming:
	- Quantity over quality
	- No critiquing yet
	- Write everything down
	- Building on ideas ("Yes And...")
	- Around 15 minutes. After that time you lose steam. Do it in bursts.
* Judgement Mode:
	* At some point after brainstorming you start to cull the ideas. 
	* Consider this when picking:
		* Feasibility
		* Fits requirements
		* Known constraints like costs, technical ability, timeline...
		* Other usability criteria like effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction
