# Summary 
This chapter describes the difference between qualitative and quantitative data/analysis. 

Both of the two kinds of data can be analyzed for patterns and trends using some simple techniques and graphs. 

Qualitative data may be analyzed inductively or deductively using thematic analysis, data categorization, etc. 

Analytical frameworks include conversation analysis, discourse analysis, content analysis, interaction analysis, grounded theory, and systems-based approaches.

Presenting results is just as important as the analysis of the data. Make sure results are contextualized. 

# Key Points
- The kind of analysis done depends on the data gathering techniques used.
- Qualitative and quantitative data may be collected from interviews, questionaries, and observations.
- Quantitative data analysis involves percentages/averages.
- 3 kinds of average: mean, median, mode.
- Graphical representations of quantitative data can help identify patterns. 
- Qualitative data can be inductively analyzed for themes, categories or deductively analyzed for existing concepts.
- Which analysis approach to use depends on the data gathered and goals of the study. 
- Analytical frameworks exist that focus on different levels of granularity with different purposes.
