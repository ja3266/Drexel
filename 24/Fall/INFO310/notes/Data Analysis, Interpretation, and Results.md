# Summary 
This chapter describes the difference between ==qualitative== and ==quantitative== data/analysis. 

Both of the two kinds of data can be analyzed for patterns and trends using some ==simple techniques and graphs==. 

Qualitative data may be analyzed ==inductively or deductively== using t==hematic analysis, data categorization==, etc. 

==Analytical frameworks== include conversation analysis, discourse analysis, content analysis, interaction analysis, grounded theory, and systems-based approaches.

==Presenting results== is just as important as the analysis of the data. Make sure results are contextualized. 

# Key Points
- The kind of analysis done depends on the data gathering techniques used.
- Qualitative and quantitative data may be collected from interviews, questionnaires, and observations.
- Quantitative data analysis involves percentages/averages.
- 3 kinds of average: mean, median, mode.
- Graphical representations of quantitative data can help identify patterns. 
- Qualitative data can be inductively analyzed for themes, categories or deductively analyzed for existing concepts.
- Which analysis approach to use depends on the data gathered and goals of the study. 
- Analytical frameworks exist that focus on different levels of granularity with different purposes. 

# Key Ideas
- Qualitative: Words, images, descriptions, quotes.
	- 3 basic techniques: identifying themes, categorizing data, analyzing critical incidents. Often used in combination.
	- First, get familiar with the data to get a feel for anything that stands out.
	- Inductive Analysis: Extracting concepts from the data itself.
		- Identifying Themes: Patterns in the topics found among the data. Could be a particular group has the same ideas, or that the same ideas come from certain behaviors or whatever. The goal is to look at the data, find some commonalities in the topics discussed, then step back and weave together some sort of narrative about the data. Can be done with affinity diagrams (The sticky notes).
	- Deductive Analysis: Using existing ideas to categorize data. 
		- Categorizing Data: Sometimes the analysis frame can be chosen beforehand based on the study goal. In this case we create some categories based on what we want to know and see if any of our data applies to it. 
	-
- Quantitative: Numbers.
	- 2 basic techniques: Averages and percents.
	- Averages:
		- Mean: average
		- Median: middle value
		- Mode: most commonly occurring number
	- Be careful about these because they could be misleading.
	- Data can be collated in to analyzable data sets. Usually in the form of tables.
	- Clean the data first before calculating averages, like remove outliers.
	- Use graphs to display the data in a way that makes sense to compare and see trends.
	- 
- First Steps at analyzing data:
	- Interviews:
		- Notes written and expanded upon immediately after the interview for clear and fresh memory.
		- Close-ended questions are treated as quantitative.
	- Questionnaires:
		- Responses stored in databases that can be easily searched/filtered.
	- Observations:
		- Can result in a variety of data like notes, pics, logs, recordings, videos, etc. 
		- Difficult part is piecing these together to create a cohesive narrative.
- Summarizing the Data:
	- Carefully consider what is the best way to present the data to someone who does not know about the topic. Also, be sure not to generalize with words like *most, all, majority* and *none*.
