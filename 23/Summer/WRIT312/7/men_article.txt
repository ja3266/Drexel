Angles for Harper's Bazaar article on "Men Have No Friends and Women Bear the Burden"

1) Scientific approach but better than the healthline article
	-Be more verbose about studies
	-Not so sweeping
	-Some anecdotal evidence but mostly numbers based

2) Historical approach
	-History of masculinity to explain how we got to this point
	-A way to move forward and evolve

3) Purely opinion, personal anecdotal approach
	-Give personal examples in detail
	-purely to try and help anyone who relates
	-Not meant to be an example, but a relatable story
